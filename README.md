The report mentioned above consists of two parts.

01. Metropolis Hastings Algorithm
      (a) Detailed instructions according to guidelines given were followed to work with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithm (specifically, the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm) to simulate a given density function. Results were compared using visual overlays.
      (b) Further, the standard deviation was varied within a controlled range to assess the convergence of the simulation by visulalizing the changes to the values of the Rhat statistic (also known as Gelman-Rubin Statistic) 

02. Flight Data Analysis 
  - The latest dataset with the highest number of records (from the year '2007') was extrated from the Harvard Dataverse Website (https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7), to perform an in depth analysis using the programming languages Python and R, in order to answer the research questions mentioned below.
      (a) What are the best times and days of the week to minimise delays each year?
      (b) Evaluate whether older planes suffer more delays on a year-to-year basis.
      (c) For each year, fit a logistic regression model for the probability of diverted US flightsusing as many features as possible from attributes of the departure date, the scheduled departure and arrival times, the coordinates and distance between departure and planned arrival airports, and the carrier. Visualize the coefficients across years

The Report comprises of the data visualisations based on both Python and Programming languages pairwise, leading to detailed comparisons and conclusions after following appropriate procedures to tackle the relevant sections of cleaned data.  
A pdf of the research questions is mentioned above including all the codes in both R and Python programming languages.
